# OmixLitMiner 2
The OmixLitMiner 2 is an automated literature search tool, which utilises the PubMed API. When provided with a gene or protein list and certain keywords, the tool first searches for the corresponding synonyms and protein names, before searching for them in combination with the provided keywords. 
The resulting publications are then classified into different categories:
| Category 	| Criteria                                      	|
|----------	|-----------------------------------------------	|
| 1        	| Review found                                  	|
| 2        	| Publication found, no review found            	|
| 3        	| Synonyms/ Protein names found, no publication 	|
| 0        	| No known synonyms or protein names            	|
